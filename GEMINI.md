# About This Vault

This repository is my digital garden and personal knowledge base, managed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It contains notes on technology, programming, and artificial intelligence.

## How It's Organized for a Clean Graph

The vault is structured using a **"Map of Content" (MOC)** system to keep the Obsidian graph view meaningful and easy to navigate.

**The Core Rule:** Every folder has a corresponding hub note named after it.

- **Example:** The `LLM/` folder contains a hub note named `LLM/LLM.md`.

This unique naming prevents the graph from collapsing different topics into a single, confusing node (which happens when using generic names like `README.md`).

## Your Workflow for Adding New Notes

To keep the graph organized as you add content, follow this simple two-step process:

**1. Create Your Note:**
   - Add your new note (e.g., `My New Idea.md`) inside the most relevant folder.

**2. Link It in the Hub:**
   - Open the hub note for that folder (e.g., `LLM/LLM.md`).
   - Add a link to your new note: `[[My New Idea]]`.

That's it. This ensures every new piece of knowledge is immediately connected to its parent topic. If you create a new folder, simply create a corresponding hub note for it and link it in the parent hub.
